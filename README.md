# README

This codebase has been generated by [Autostrada](https://autostrada.dev/).

## Getting started

Before running the application you will need a working PostgreSQL installation and a valid DSN (data source name) for connecting to the database.

Please open the `cmd/api/main.go` file and edit the `db-dsn` command-line flag to include your valid DSN as the default value.

```
flag.StringVar(&cfg.db.dsn, "db-dsn", "YOUR DSN GOES HERE", "postgreSQL DSN")
```

Make sure that you're in the root of the project directory, fetch the dependencies with `go mod tidy`, then run the application using `go run ./cmd/api`:

```
$ go mod tidy
$ go run ./cmd/api
```

If you make a request to the `GET /status` endpoint using `curl` you should get a response like this:

```
$ curl -i localhost:4444/status
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Mon, 09 May 2022 20:46:37 GMT
Content-Length: 23

{
    "Status": "OK",
}
```

## Application version

The application version number is defined in a `Get()` function in the `internal/version/version.go` file. Feel free to change this as necessary.

```
package version

func Get() string {
    return "0.0.1"
}
```

## Changing the module path

The module path is currently set to `dvm.wallet/harsh`. If you want to change this please find and replace all instances of `dvm.wallet/harsh` in the codebase with your own module path.
